  <p style="text-align:center;font-size:20px;">Attribute subset Selection is an approach which is used for data reduction in data mining process. Data reduction reduces the size of data so that it can be used for analysis purposes more efficiently.</p>
  <h4>Need for Attribute Subset Selection:</h4>
  <p>Our data set may have a large number of attributes. But some of those attributes could be irrelevant or redundant. The goal of attribute subset selection is to find a minimum set of attributes like dropping of those irrelevant attributes would not much affect the utility of data and the cost of data analysis could be reduced.</p>
